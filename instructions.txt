After  creating the three routes, I use postman for API testing.

== Users Testing
_ First I created a new collection named "Users Testing". 
_ Inside collection, I created a new 'GET' request named as "base url test".
_ The URL of the request was 'localhost:3000/users'. I save this url inside a variable named as 'baseurl'. The scope of variable was its collection. 
_ I send the request and save after after the response comes.

== Products Testing
_ First I created a new collection named "Products Testing". 
_ Inside collection, I created a new 'GET' request named as "base url test".
_ The URL of the request was 'localhost:3000/products'. I save this url inside a variable named as 'baseurl'. The scope of variable was its collection. 
_ I send the request and save after after the response comes.

== Owners Testing
_ First I created a new collection named "Owners Testing". 
_ Inside collection, I created a new 'GET' request named as "base url test".
_ The URL of the request was 'localhost:3000/owners'. I save this url inside a variable named as 'baseurl'. The scope of variable was its collection. 
_ I send the request and save after after the response comes.
